#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the application of a systematic, displined, and quantified approach to the ddevelopment, operation, and maintenance of sioftware. It ensures efficient, scalable, and cost-effective software development, hence essential in the technology industry. It helps manage complexity, improve software quality, and ensure maintainability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Intruduction of structured programing (1960s-70s)-it reduced programmes complexity by breaking them into functions/modules.
2. Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)- This allowed for better modularity and reusability using objects and classes.
3. Agile Methodology(2001-present)- Focuses on iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility in execution of projects.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Feasibility study - Determines whether the project is viable.
2. Requirement analysis and specification - user and system requiremments are defined.
3. Software Designe - architecting the sollution.
4. Implementation (coding) - writing the actual code.
5. Testing - verifying functionality through different types of testing.
6. Development - Releasing the product to users.
7. Maintenance - Updating and fixing software post-deployment​.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall Model: A linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government or banking systems​.
2. Agile Model: Iterative development with continuous feedback and flexibility. Suitable for startups or dynamic projects where requirements evolve, like mobile app development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures software quality through testing.
3. Project Manager: Oversees project timelines, resources, and communication between stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA): Provide an environment for writing, debugging, and testing code efficiently.
2. VCS (e.g., Git, GitHub, GitLab): Track code changes, enable collaboration, and maintain version history​.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

   1. Managing Complexity - Use modular design and documentation.
   2. Changing Requirements - Adopt Agile methodologies.
   3. Debugging Difficulties - Implement systematic testing and logging.
   4. Version Conflicts - Use version control systems like Git.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

   1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components.
   2. Integration Testing – Ensures modules work together.
   3. System Testing – Validates the entire system.
   4. Acceptance Testing – Confirms if software meets user requirements​.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

   Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective inputs thet is prompts, for AI models to generate desired responses.
   It improves accuracy and relevance in AI interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

  Example of Prompt Improvement
  
  Vague Prompt: "Can you tell me about cars."
   
  Improved Prompt: "Provide an overview of electric cars, including their advantages, disadvantages, and leading manufacturers."
  The improved prompt is clearsince it is specific, and directs the AI to focus on a particular aspect.
